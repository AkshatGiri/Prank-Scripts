# Running the script on a Mac
Open a terminal and run these commands first. <br>
( This will ensure that they have python3 and PyAutoGui installed )
 
```
brew install pyton3 
pip3 install pyautogui
```
 
 After that you can go ahead and run the script from the terminal. 
 ```
 python3 HauntedCursor.py
 ```
 
 # Running the script on a PC
 Unfortunately there is no easy way of installing python on a windows machine. 
 You will need to go and download the python3 installer and then install it.
 
 I will soon be uploading an .exe file which will accomplish the same thing as this script but more easily. 
 
 
 # Running on a Linux Machine
 I'm sure you can figure it out ;)
 
 
 
 # Stuff I want to do 
 - Run the script in background ( without a terminal )
 - Run the script on startup
 - Make the script more intricate and harder to detect
